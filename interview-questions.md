# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: "Parameter" is a placeholder for the data that the user passes information too in the function. The "Argument" is the data that is passed to the parameter. The "Parameter" represents data but does not contain any data itself. 



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: The .map() function has five predefined parameters they are function, value, index, array, and thisValue. The two required parameters are function ()=>{} and value. 



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Object destructuring is the practice of assigning the different keys within an object to their own specific variables. Object destructering makes it possible to unpack the keys into an array. Object destructuring breaks down the value and creates a new variable and assigns them into a single assignment. An example of this might be a hyperlink in a word document. Or if we had a variable object car that has two keys color and brand, We could destructer the keys out of the object using the destructering syntax 
  var { color, brand } = car 
  var curly brace color, key curly brace equals car. 
  
  This would give me access to the values of color and brand. With this access I could reassign the color to be something different by just calling on color not by calling on car.color. 


4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: 

  Researched answer: A method is something that preforms a task. A method is always associated with an object and a function is not associated with an object or a specific code block. Functions can manipulate objects but do not reside inside an object.  Functions are dependent on the information passed to them in the function invocation, whereas methods have access to the input information and the properties of the associated object where the method is being stored. This allows the developer to call on "this.key" to access any property in the object within the method alongside the methods parameters.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: 

  Researched answer: An object is a container for information. it contains methods and data. A class is a set of blueprints and instructions the object needs to follow upon instantiation. The behavior of the information inside the object is dictated by the class.  



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:

  Researched answer: Before the execution of code interpreter moves the functions, variables, classes to the top of the scripts scope which allows the invocation of the function before it's even defined. You can also use classes before they are defined. Variables only get declare and not initialized. You can reassign a variable but not use the initial value before it's defined. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: A method of reusing functions from a parent class in a child class.

2. React: A library of reusable and commonly used components

3. React state: An object used by react to represent information about the components current situation. 

4. React lifecycle methods: Each component in react has a life cycle with three phases that can be monitored. The phases are Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. render(), componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), componentWillUnmount(). 

5. DOM: The Document Object Model is an interface for web documents. It represents the page so other programs can interact, change, and style the content.
